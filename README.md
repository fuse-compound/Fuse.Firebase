This project's goal to make full Firebase bindings for Fuse. Currently we have Authentication using the Email, Google & Facebook providers.

All are welcome to come hacking on this so we can flesh this out to cover the full gammut of features provided by Firebase! Whether it's as small as a typo fix or as large and a entire feature, please feel free to fork and summit pull requests.

## Docs

See the [wiki](https://github.com/cbaggers/Fuse.Firebase/wiki) for [API Docs](https://github.com/cbaggers/Fuse.Firebase/wiki/Javascript-API) and the [guide for getting the authentication example running](https://github.com/cbaggers/Fuse.Firebase/wiki/Getting-up-and-running-with-the-Example-Project).

## Requirements

- Fuse version >= 0.25: This is needed as a bunch of changes shipped in that version to make this all possible including appcompat7 Activity as super class for the app's activity
- Firebase account

For authentication you also need a Facebook developer account
